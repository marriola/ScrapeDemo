A sample scraper definition.

A scraper is conceptualized as a series of steps, which are represented by <step> nodes. The id
property corresponds to the scraper step ID as returned by AddScraperStep.

A step corresponds to a web page, so the <step> element contains a list of HTML elements, represented
by the <element> element. <element> has a "name" attribute, which is the name exposed to the scraper,
and a series of attributes "id", "name" and "class" which are matched the target element on the page.
If the element may or may not be present on the page, its "optional" attribute should be set to "true."
Otherwise, the scraper will throw an exception if that element is not present.
